HIGH-LEVEL DESIGN
Shipping Label Maker is an application that collects shipping information from the user and prints a shipping label. The heart of the application is a wizard whose primary responsibility is to receive a series of steps and sequencing through them. The steps will instruct the wizard to move forward or backwards or end the wizard. The wizard should not know anything about the business domain. Following are the steps of the Shipping Label Maker.
Step 1- Get Sender’s Address
Step 2 – Get Receiver’s Address
Step 3 – Get Package Weight
Step 4 – Get Shipping option (Ground or Priority)
Step 5 – Review and Confirm
The wireframe of the wizard is shown below. It consists of a header, a progress bar and the current step. You may use raw CSS or a UI component library (such as Material UI or Bootstrap) to make this look good. After all, looks are important!
